## Introduction

This project is the notes I recorded while studying for the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination subjects: "**Computer Professional Basic Comprehensive**" (subject code: 408). In addition to helping myself review and consolidate, I hope it can also help more people in need. Wishing everyone good luck in the exam and success in one shot! 

This project is currently being updated irregularly, and it may record detailed explanations of past 408 exam questions in the future. Please stay tuned~
